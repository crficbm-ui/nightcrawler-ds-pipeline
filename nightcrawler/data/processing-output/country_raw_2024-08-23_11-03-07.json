        "full_description": "Uses\n\nSildenafil is used to treat male sexual function problems (impotence or erectile dysfunction-ED). In combination with sexual stimulation, sildenafil works by increasing blood flow to the penis to help a man get and keep an erection.This drug does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, syphilis). Practice \" safe sex\" such as using latex condoms. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\nHow to use Viagra\n\nRead the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking sildenafil and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nTo treat erectile dysfunction-ED, take this drug by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually as needed. Take sildenafil at least 30 minutes, but no more than 4 hours, before sexual activity (1 hour before is the most effective). Do not take more than once daily.\n\nA high- fat meal may delay how quickly the drug begins to work.\n\nThe dosage is based on your medical condition, response to treatment, and other medications you may be taking. Be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\n\nTell your doctor if your condition does not improve.\n\nSide Effects\n\nDizziness, headache, flushing, or stomach upset may occur. Vision changes such as increased sensitivity to light, blurred vision, or trouble telling blue and green colors apart may also occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\nTo reduce the risk of dizziness and lightheadedness, get up slowly when rising from a sitting or lying position.\n\nRemember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\nSexual activity may put extra strain on your heart, especially if you have heart problems. If you have heart problems and experience any of these serious side effects while having sex, stop and get medical help right away: severe dizziness, fainting, chest/jaw/left arm pain, nausea.\n\nRarely, sudden decreased vision, including permanent blindness, in one or both eyes (NAION) may occur. If this serious problem occurs, stop taking sildenafil and get medical help right away. You have a slightly greater chance of developing NAION if you have heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, certain other eye problems (\"crowded disk\"), high blood pressure, if you are over 50, or if you smoke.\n\nRarely, a sudden decrease or loss of hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and dizziness, may occur.

Your doctor may start treatment with a lower dose of sildenafil to minimize your risk of low blood pressure.\n\nOther medications can affect the removal of sildenafil from your body, which may affect how sildenafil works. Examples include azole antifungals (such as itraconazole, ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin), mifepristone, rifampin, ritonavir, among others.\n\nDo not take this medication with any other product that contains sildenafil or other similar medications for erectile dysfunction -ED or pulmonary hypertension (such as tadalafil, vardenafil).\n\nDoes Viagra interact with other drugs you are taking?\n\nEnter your medication into the WebMD interaction checker\n\nCheck Interaction\n\nOverdose\n\nIf someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing, call 911.
